# NewsClassification
Conducted text mining analysis for classifying News Categories Using TF-IDF and Skipgram Representations with SVM and Random Forest  
●	Scraped data from major news websites, including Detik and CNBC.  
●	Performed text preprocessing, including cleaning and filtering steps, to prepare the data for analysis.  
●	Employed two text representation methods: TF-IDF and Skipgram.  
●	Built text classification models using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms.  
●	Found that, on average, the TF-IDF representation outperformed Skipgram for this dataset, making it a more effective choice. Additionally, Random Forest demonstrated higher accuracy than SVM across metrics. The best model—using TF-IDF with both SVM and Random Forest—achieved an accuracy of 0.97, with precision, recall, and F1-score all at 0.97.
